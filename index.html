    <section class="main-content">
      <p>The need to represent knowledge about food is central to many fields including biomedicine and sustainable development. <a href="https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon">FOODON</a> is a new ontology built to interoperate with the <a href="http://obofoundry.org">OBO Library</a> and to represent entities which bear a “food role”. It encompasses materials in natural ecosystems and food webs as well as human- centric categorization and handling of food. The latter will be the initial focus of the ontology, and we aim to develop semantics for food safety, food security, the agricultural and animal husbandry practices linked to food production, culinary, nutritional and chemical ingredients and processes.  This project is motivated by the recognition that although several resources and standards for indexing food descriptors currently exist, their content and interrelations are not semantically and logically coherent. </p>

<p>The scope of FOODON is ambitious and will require input from multiple domains. FOODON will import or map to material in existing ontologies and standards and will create content to cover gaps in the representation of food-related products and processes. The products of this work are being applied to research and clinical datasets such as those associated with the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study which examines the causal factors of asthma and allergy development in children, and the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) platform for genomic epidemiology and foodborne outbreak investigation.</p>

<h3>Mailing List</h3>
<p>We have just started up a new <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/foodon-consortium/join" target="_blank">mailing list</a></strong>. </p>
<h3>
<a id="consortium" class="anchor" href="#consortium" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Consortium</h3>

<p>As a robust food ontology can only be created by consensus and wide adoption, we are currently forming an international, open-membership consortium to build partnerships, solicit domain expertise, and gather use cases to guide the ontology’s development. </p>

<p>Founding members</p>

<ul>
<li>William Hsiao, Fiona Brinkman, Damion Dooley and Emma Griffiths are involved in the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis project; their focus is on ontology of food-borne pathogen related (genomic) epidemiology (GenEpiO). Fiona and Emma  are also involved in The Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study (CHILD) investigating genetic and environmental factors associated with the development of allergy and asthma.</li>
<li>Pier Luigi Buttigieg is developing environmental ontologies (ENVO) and semantics for sustainable development. These domains include the semantics of food production, security, and composition.</li>
<li>Robert Hoehndorf, a key proponent of the Aber-OWL.net project, is researching chemical exposure with respect to diet and health.</li>
<li>Matthew Lange spearheads the IC3-Foods consortium, with a focus on the technology and policy implications of next generation food systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the International Conference on Biological Ontology &amp; BioCreative on August 1-4, 2016 in Corvallis Oregon, we will be hosting 
a <a href="http://icbo.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/node/38">foundational workshop</a> on the food ontology. Join us for a discussion of the different subdomains, and the planning of its development.</p>

<p>Currently, while we get started, online discussion will be handled by the existing foodon membership via the <a href="https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>
