    <section class="main-content">
      <p>The need to represent knowledge about food is central to many human activities including agriculture, medicine, 
        food safety inspection, shopping patterns, and sustainable development. 
        <a href="https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon">FoodOn</a> is a new ontology built to interoperate with the 
        <a href="http://obofoundry.org" target="_blank">OBO Library</a> and to represent entities which bear a “food role”. 
        Initially the ontology will focus on the human-centric categorization and handling of food, but in the future it will 
        also encompass materials in natural ecosystems and food webs. We aim to develop semantics 
        for food safety, food security, the agricultural and animal husbandry practices linked to food production, 
        culinary, nutritional and chemical ingredients and processes.</p>

<p>The scope of FoodOn is ambitious and will require input from multiple domains. FoodOn imports material 
  from several ontologies covering anatomy, taxonomy, geography and cultural heritage.  We aim to create content to cover 
  gaps in the representation of food-related products and processes. This ontology is being applied to 
  research and clinical datasets in academia and government.  We also anticipate industry uptake since agricultural
  and consumer devices connected to the Internet of Things will require a standard food vocabulary that has a global, multilingual reach.</p>

<h3>FoodOn Content</h3>
      <p><strong> We have launched the ALPHA version of FoodOn</strong>, based largely on <a href="http://langual.org" target="_blank">LanguaL</a>,
        a descriptive food indexing system that has terms organized in facets that describe source ingredients, 
        food preservation, cooking, consumer groups, etc. (see a great PDF presentation <a href="http://www.langual.org/download/Presentation/LanguaLpresentation%202015-10-04.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).  
        Food can also be linked to its cultural or geographic 
        origin, and to its animal, plant or fungi raw ingredient taxonomy.  You can view it at the EBI
        <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/foodon" target="_blank">Ontology Lookup Service</a>.</p>

      <img src="docs/media/food_design.png" />

      <p> We have begun the process of creating logical definitions for a large number of food products that were introduced by
        way of the LanguaL-indexed SIREN database (see http://www.langual.org/langual_indexed_datasets.asp). Currently these 
        products are organized manually under the "foodon food product" facet hierarchy, but this will be transformed into
        an inferred structure as product definitions are updated. An example of more fine-grained axiomatization is shown below,
        where three different kinds of apple-related products are shown in relation to a food source organism (apple tree) and 
        varions food preparation and packaging processes.</p>
      
      <img src="docs/media/apple-diagram.png" />
      
      <p> FoodOn has LanguaL identifiers for references to all LanguaL food source items and other facet descriptors that FoodOn
        has imported. However, ontology relations allow us to improve the way components and processes are represented in order 
        to sow the benefits of automated reasoning on food product schemas. </p>

<h3>Consortium</h3>

<p>As a robust food ontology can only be created by consensus and wide adoption, we are currently forming an 
  international, open-membership consortium to build partnerships, solicit domain expertise, and gather 
  use cases to guide the ontology’s development. </p>
