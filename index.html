    <section class="main-content">
      <p>The need to represent knowledge about food is central to many fields including biomedicine and sustainable development. 
        <a href="https://github.com/FoodOntology/foodon">FoodOn</a> is a new ontology built to interoperate with the 
        <a href="http://obofoundry.org">OBO Library</a> and to represent entities which bear a “food role”. 
        It encompasses materials in natural ecosystems and food webs as well as human- centric categorization 
        and handling of food. The latter will be the initial focus of the ontology, and we aim to develop semantics 
        for food safety, food security, the agricultural and animal husbandry practices linked to food production, 
        culinary, nutritional and chemical ingredients and processes.  This project is motivated by the recognition 
        that although several resources and standards for indexing food descriptors currently exist, their content 
        and interrelations are not semantically and logically coherent. </p>

<p>The scope of FoodOn is ambitious and will require input from multiple domains. FoodOn will import or map to material 
  in existing ontologies and standards and will create content to cover gaps in the representation of food-related products 
  and processes. The products of this work are being applied to research and clinical datasets such as those associated 
  with the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study which examines the causal factors of asthma and 
  allergy development in children, and the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) platform for genomic 
  epidemiology and foodborne outbreak investigation.</p>

<h3>FoodOn Content</h3>
      <p><strong> We have launched the ALPHA version of FoodOn</strong>, based largely on <a href="http://langual.org" target="_blank">LanguaL</a>,
        a descriptive food indexing system that has terms organized in facets that describe source ingredients, 
        food preservation, cooking, consumer groups, etc.  Food can also be described by its cultural or geographic 
        origin, and by animal, plant or fungi taxonomy.</p>

<li>*William Hsiao* and *Damion Dooley* (University of British Columbia Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine) 
  and Fiona Brinkman and Emma Griffiths (Simon Fraser University Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry) 
  are involved in the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis IRIDA.ca project; their focus is on ontology 
  of food-borne pathogen related (genomic) epidemiology (GenEpiO). Fiona and Emma are also involved in The Canadian 
  Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study (CHILD) investigation of genetic and environmental factors associated 
  with the development of allergy and asthma.</li>
<li>*Pier Luigi Buttigieg* (Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology) is developing environmental ontologies (ENVO) 
  and semantics for sustainable development. These domains include the semantics of food production, security, and composition.</li>
<li>*Robert Hoehndorf* (King Abdullah University), a key proponent of the Aber-OWL.net project, is researching chemical 
  exposure with respect to diet and health.</li>
<li>*Matthew Lange* (UC Davis School of Medicine Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Institute for Wireless Health and Wellness) spearheads the 
  IC3-Foods consortium, with a focus on the technology and policy implications of next generation food systems.</li>

<a id="consortium" class="anchor" href="#consortium" aria-hidden="true"></a>Consortium</h3>

<p>As a robust food ontology can only be created by consensus and wide adoption, we are currently forming an 
  international, open-membership consortium to build partnerships, solicit domain expertise, and gather 
  use cases to guide the ontology’s development. </p>
